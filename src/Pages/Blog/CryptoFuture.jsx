            <p>
              During the release of the new budget in 2022, The Finance Minister
              of India, Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman gave a speech and stated -{" "}
              <b>
                India will introduce its central bank backed - first digital
                rupee using blockchain technology by 2023 year, issued by the
                Reserve Bank of India. Further the minister said- The launch of
                CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) in 2022-2023 will boost the
                Indian Digital Economy.{" "}
              </b>
              <br />
              Further, RBI indicated that the digital currency would be set to
              launch by the end of next financial year. RBI will be able to
              trace all the digital transactions unlike other crypto
              transactions happening worldwide. So, instead of carrying rupees
              in your hand, you will have the digital currency in your wallet.{" "}
              <br />
              It means, India will witness its first digital rupee and by the
              launch of digital rupee, the blackmarket of crypto established in
              India will also get a hold! <br />
              <br />
              The Government has already clarified that they are against private
              cryptocurrency and have no further plans to accept it legally. The
              Central government is imposing this action because of national
              data security and financial stability of the country.
