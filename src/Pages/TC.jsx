        <h3>1- Scope of Services offered by Paypenny </h3>
        Only the following Services are offered and operated by Paypenny.
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>1.1 Supported Cryptocurrencies.</b> The Paypenny wallet allows you
          to send and receive cryptocurrency (together, “Wallet Transactions”).
          The Paypenny wallet is only available in relation to the
          cryptocurrencies that Paypenny, in its sole discretion, decides to
          support (“Supported Cryptocurrency” or “Supported Cryptocurrencies”).
          The Supported Cryptocurrencies may change from time to time. Under no
          circumstances should you attempt to carry out a Paypenny Wallet
          Transaction in relation to a cryptocurrency other than a Supported
          Cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1.2 Transaction instructions.</b> Paypenny will process Wallet
          Transactions according to your instructions. You accept and agree
          that: <br />
          i) Paypenny does not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or
          another party to a Paypenny Wallet Transaction. You are solely
          responsible for ensuring all transaction details are correct, and you
          should carefully verify all transaction information prior to
          submitting transaction instructions to Paypenny; <br />
          <br />
          ii) Paypenny does not have any control over, or any liability in
          relation to, the delivery, quality, or any other aspect of any goods
          or services that you may buy from or sell to any third party. Paypenny
          shall not be responsible for, and will take no action in relation to,
          ensuring that any buyer or seller you transact with using your
          Paypenny wallet completes the relevant transaction or has the
          requisite authority to do so; <br />
          <br />
          iii) if you send Supported Cryptocurrency using the Paypenny wallet,
          you shall send such Supported Cryptocurrency only to another
          blockchain wallet owned by you; or if you send Supported
          Cryptocurrency using the Paypenny wallet to a third party, you shall
          not receive any consideration for such transfer,
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1.3 Receiving cryptocurrency.</b> You may receive Supported
          Cryptocurrency into your Paypenny wallet by providing the sender with
          a receive address generated in your Paypenny wallet. Your Paypenny
          wallet will only be credited with Supported Cryptocurrency sent to a
          receive address generated through your Paypenny wallet and associated
          with that Supported Cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1.4 Trading between Supported Cryptocurrencies.</b> Paypenny allows
          you to trade with other Users between various Supported
          Cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC-ETH, BTC-LTC, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1.5 Sharing User Information.</b> In the course of processing
          Wallet Transactions, Paypenny may be required to share your user
          information with other contractual third parties, or as required under
          applicable laws or demanded upon a lawful request by any governmental
          authority. You hereby irrevocably grant full permission and authority
          for Paypenny to share this information with such contractual third
          parties, or as required under applicable laws or demanded upon a
          lawful request by any governmental authority, and release Paypenny
          from any liability, error, mistake, or negligence related thereto.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1.6 Trade Corrections.</b> You acknowledge and agree that Paypenny
          may correct, reverse or cancel, in its sole discretion, any order,
          trade, transfer, or other transaction or activity with respect to
          which Paypenny has discovered that there was an error or abnormality,
          whether such error or abnormality was caused by you, Paypenny or a
          third party or due to technical issues, system issues, software
          failure or otherwise. Paypenny provides no guarantee or warranty that
          any such attempt will be successful and will have no responsibility or
          liability for such error(s) or any correction attempt(s).
        </p>
        <h3>2 Fees & Taxes</h3>
        <p>
          i) You agree to pay Paypenny the fees which may be updated from time
          to time in our sole discretion. Any such updated fees will apply
          prospectively to any trades or other transactions that take place
          following the effective date of such updated fees. You authorize
          Paypenny to remove any amounts from your Account for any applicable
          fees owed by you under this Agreement. <br />
          ii) Withdrawal / Send fees. You may be charged a fee to send or
          withdraw a Supported Cryptocurrency from your Paypenny wallet. We
          currently do not charge fees to deposit or receive Supported
          Cryptocurrency into your Paypenny wallet. <br />
          iii) Taxes. All fees paid by you shall be made free and clear of, and
          without reduction for, any and all taxes, except any required
          withholding of taxes pursuant to applicable law or on account of any
          Goods and Services Tax to the extent applicable. In case where you
          withhold taxes pursuant to applicable law, you shall furnish to us a
          statement detailing such withholding and deposit of withheld taxes.

          terminated by either you or Paypenny. Any provision of this Agreement
          which, either by its terms or to give effect to its meaning, must
          survive, and such other provisions which expressly, or by their

          the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the

          means “including without limitation”. If any provision of this
